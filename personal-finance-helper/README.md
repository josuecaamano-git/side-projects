# Personal Finance Helper (Backlog)

**Goal:** Privacy-first dashboard to organize assets, subscriptions, and yearly tax prep tasks (CH/EU oriented).

## Concept
- Upload statements or type quick entries.
- Auto-categorize and highlight missing items for tax/prep.
- Generate a checklist and calendar reminders.

## Initial Scope
- Manual input + file naming conventions.
- Export a yearly checklist (PDF/CSV).
- No bank connections in v1.

## Roadmap
- v0.1: Local CSV prototype.  
- v0.2: Simple UI for data entry & export.  
- v0.3: Country-specific tax checklist presets (CH first).
